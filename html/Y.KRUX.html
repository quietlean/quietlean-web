                    So far music has been my greatest hobby and I produced what
                    I was feeling like at that time. This resultet into an 
                    assortment of all kinds of music. Since I started 
                    uploading my music right after i started geting into 
                    musicproduction there are a lot of low quality songs. For 
                    me this is more of an archive of my muscial development 
                    rather than a super serious project. So I dont really 
                    care if my songs sound a lil crooked ^^. I'll might go 
                    more professional in the future tough. So stay tuned.
